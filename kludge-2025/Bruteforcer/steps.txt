since the encryption scheme is using md5 and sha256 hashes of the actual key in encryption,
the only way to recover key is to guess using rockyou.txt

after bruteforcing you get key to be r0cky0u

wc -l plaintexts.txt -> 1000
wc -l ciphertexts.txt -> 999

so we encrypt each word in plaintexts.txt and check if it is present in ciphertexts.txt. 

the one which is not is to be pasted in pastebin
