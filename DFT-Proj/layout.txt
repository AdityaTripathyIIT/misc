Goal 1: 
  Given: a function A sin(kx)sin(mx) - k, A, m  are randomly chosen, we don't care for now.
  TODO:
  1) Sample it a 2 * max(k, m) rate.
  2) Take DFT of the sampled function
  3) Relate where the clumps are centered to k and m 

Goal 2:
  Given: a function sin(kx)\sum{A_m sin(mx)} - k, m, A are randomly chosen, we don't care for now.
  TODO:
  1) Sample it a 2 * max(k, m) rate.
  2) Take DFT of the sampled function
  3) Relate where the clumps are centered to k and m 
  4) Try to relate the amplitude at some point in the spectrum to the A_m coefficient

Goal 3:
  Given: a function \sum{A_mn sin(kx)sin(mx)} - k, m and a are randomly chosen, we don't care for now.
  TODO:
  1) Sample it a 2 * max(k, m) rate.
  2) Take DFT of the sampled function
  3) Relate where the clumps are centered to k and m 
  4) Try to relate the amplitude at some point in the spectrum to the A_m coefficient

Goal 4: Backtrack
